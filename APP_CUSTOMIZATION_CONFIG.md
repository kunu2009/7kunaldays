🎯 EVOLUTION OS — COMPLETE APP CUSTOMIZATION (FILLED FOR KUNAL)

Purpose: Complete configuration + developer guidance so any AI / dev can update the Evolution OS Flutter app to Kunal’s exact data and behaviour.

🛠️ APP-BUILDER GUIDE — HOW / WHAT / WHERE (Make the app make Kunal high-performing)

Below is a pragmatic, developer-friendly implementation guide. Use it to translate the filled questionnaire into the app’s behavior, AI prompts, UI components, data models, and edge-case handling.

1) CONFIG INGESTION (recommended JSON schema)

Provide an APP_CUSTOMIZATION_CONFIG.json ingestion endpoint or file loader. Example shape (abbreviated):

{
  "user": {
    "name": "Kunal",
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
    "profile": { "age": null, "avatar": null }
  },
  "goals": {
    "exam": { "name":"MHCET 5-Year LLB", "date":"2026-05-01", "targetRank":50 }
  },
  "timeline": [ { "start":"06:00", "end":"06:45", "title":"Morning Workout", "type":"fitness" }, ... ],
  "dailyMissions": {
    "academic":[ { "title":"2 deep blocks", "target":"240m" }, ...],
    "fitness":[ ... ], "brand":[ ... ], "confidence":[ ... ]
  },
  "nutrition": { "meals":[ { "name":"Breakfast", "time":"07:15", "items":["Milk","Banana","Peanuts"], "cal":350 } ] },
  "metrics": { "studyHours": {"today":4,"target":6}, "water": {"today":1.5,"target":2.5} }
}


Implement: import mapper that creates DB records, scheduled notifications, and pre-fills UI.

2) AI COMPANION RULES (Balanced Mentor)

Tone: Calm, concise, firm, gently motivational. Max 3–5 lines for default responses.

Decision logic:

If Focus_Level < 5 → suggest micro tasks (20–30 min) & movement break.

If StudyHours < 50% of target by midday → propose focused block and block phone.

If Workout not completed by 07:30 AM → prompt “Do a short 10-min bodyweight set now” (adaptive).

Daily Startup Prompt (run at 06:00):

Show today’s 3 missions + quick justification (why mission matters to goals).

End-of-day:

Auto-generate reflection summary using logged data and prompt the reflection card questions.

Implementation: expose an AI prompt template (server or local) with variables (Focus_Level, StudyHours, WorkoutDone, Streaks, YesterdayFailures). Keep responses short and action-focused.

3) MISSION GENERATION LOGIC

Base rules:

Always generate exactly 3 daily primary missions (1 academic, 1 fitness, 1 brand/confidence) + optional micro missions.

Use yesterday’s unmet tasks as priority for next day.

Keep one mission as “non-negotiable” (morning workout or first deep study block based on day).

Auto-check heuristics:

If study timer ran > 90% of target minutes → auto-check mission complete.

If workout checklist logged all pre-checked items → auto-complete.

Allow user manual override with reason (quick dropdown).

4) SCHEDULER & PROTECTED BLOCKS

Protected blocks (06:00–08:00, 08:00–12:15, 21:30–22:45) must be configurable and flagged isProtected:true in calendar.

If a protected block conflict appears (calendar event), show twice-modal: (1) short modal offering reschedule options, (2) emergency accept with “reset streak” consequences (explain to user).

Offline-first: Local DB (SQLite) for timeline and missions. Sync to cloud when online.

5) NOTIFICATIONS & REMINDERS

Water reminders: Every 2 hours between 06:00–22:00, adjustable. Tapping “+1” increments water metric.

Mission reminders: Two reminders per mission (start window + deadline). Defer to AI when user snoozes more than twice.

Streak celebration: After hitting milestone (7/30/100 hours) show modal + share option. Keep animations minimal.

6) UX BEHAVIOR (to increase adherence)

Minimal friction: one-tap “Start Study” opens full-screen timer, hides notifications, toggles Do-Not-Disturb (soft).

Quick logs: long-press the app icon or a widget to +Study 30m, +Water, +Workout complete.

Failure handling: if missions missed, ask AI for corrective micro-plan (no guilt — immediate fix).

Reflection flow: evening prompts should be required before sleep streak counts (20–30s input, quick checkboxes).

7) DATA & METRICS (what to show)

Today: Study hours, Workout complete (Y/N), Water L, Missions completed (X / 3)

Week: Study hours, Sleep avg, Energy avg, Content posted, Subject progress

Subject progress: allow drill-down to topic-level (History → Medieval → % progress)

Export: weekly PDF with charts (Study hours, Sleep, Water, Mission completion).

8) BRAND HUB IMPLEMENTATION

Vault: simple searchable DB of ideas (title, script, tags, status)

Content calendar: drag-and-drop week view with publish reminders

Quick video creator: template script → one-tap auto-caption suggestions from AI (tone: short, punchy hooks).

Metrics: ingest handles (Instagram/YouTube) via manual input or APIs if available.

9) STUDY COMMAND CENTER FEATURES

Subject progress bars, next-sessions suggestion, revision calendar (spaced repetition), auto-create flashcards from notes (AI).

Timer integration: 2-hour default with 15-min breaks. Provide alternative Pomodoro templates.

Mock scheduler: schedule weekly mock, show countdown, auto-lock study time 1 hour before test.

10) FITNESS COMMAND CENTER FEATURES

Workout templates (morning default) — give alternatives when user lacks energy (short 10–15 min sets).

Height module: show posture exercises, hanging reminders, spinal decompression guidance (note: no medical claims).

Nutrition quick-logger: pre-filled meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner) with toggle to edit calories.

Progress photos: privacy-first (store only local, optional cloud sync).

11) CONFIDENCE LAB FEATURES

Mirror talk recorder (3-min): store audio, provide AI micro-feedback (3 bullets: volume, speed, posture). Keep feedback encouraging + specific.

Video review: allow upload of talking-head clip; AI highlights 3 things to fix. (Local processing preferred, cloud optional).

12) PRIVACY & OFFLINE REQUIREMENTS

Local-first: everything must work offline — timers, logging, mission checking, streaks, reflection.

Optional cloud: provide encrypted sync with explicit user opt-in.

Security: optional PIN/biometric lock; hide data in app previews/screenshots.

13) EDGE CASES & FAILURE MODES

Missed protected block: app prompts for micro-repair plan (10–20 min rescue block) and logs reason.

Repeated snooze of mission → escalate to gentle accountability: reduce next day brand mission priority, strengthen morning mission.

Inconsistent sleep → app suggests reduced cognitive load study (20–30 min micro tasks) and earlier sleep.

If water logging is low 3+ days → show hydration streak challenge.

14) DEVELOPER CHECKLIST (priority)

 Implement import of APP_CUSTOMIZATION_CONFIG.json with mapping + validation.

 Local DB & offline-first logic.

 AI Companion prompt templates + safe fallback texts.

 Protected time blocks enforcement & conflict modal.

 Quick actions (global).

 Reflection modal + required before sleep (configurable).

 Exportable weekly PDF report.

 Privacy toggles + PIN/Fingerprint.

 Unit tests for mission auto-complete logic and streak calculations.

15) SAMPLE AI PROMPTS (copy-paste for service)

Morning briefing (template):

You are Kunal’s Balanced Mentor. Time: {{local_time}} Asia/Kolkata.
Data: {studyHoursToday, workoutDone, waterL, yesterdayMissionsCompleted, focusLevel, sleepHours}
Respond in 3 lines:
1) What to do now (single action),
2) Why this matters (one sentence),
3) Gentle motivational cue + next time to check.


Missed protected block prompt:

Kunal missed protected block [08:00–10:00]. Offer one rescue micro-plan (30–45 min) that restores 50% of lost progress and one clear reason to avoid repeat. Keep tone calm and tactical.

16) FINAL NOTES FOR BUILDERS

Design philosophy: Minimal, tactile, low-distraction. Dark & Light modes auto-switch.

Behavioural philosophy: Protect morning + first deep blocks. Always present the user a micro-step when motivation is low. Make data actionable, not just pretty charts.

Make AI accountable: AI suggestions must include an exact next action (e.g., Start History for 50 minutes at 14:30 and close book) — no vague suggestions.
